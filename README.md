# Multi-Step Form with React

## Overview

This project is a multi-step form built with React, implementing personal information, address information, and confirmation steps. The form includes data validation, error handling, navigation controls, local storage persistence, and responsive design.

## Assumptions and Decisions

- Form validation rules ensure all fields are required.
- Data is persisted to local storage to allow users to revisit the form without losing data.
- React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` are used for state management and side effects.
- CSS is used for styling, ensuring the form is responsive and visually appealing.
